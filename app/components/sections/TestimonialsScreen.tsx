          <p>I cannot recommend Curtis and Wanitta enough! They have truly made our relationship stronger in ways that we couldn’t imagine. The coaching sessions helped us to improve our communication skills by teaching us how to actively listen to each other and communicate our needs and feelings effectively. Through this me and my partner have had a decrease in conflict as we now know how to address issues before they escalate.</p>

          <p>Whenever I have attended a live session or read any of the posts from &lsquo;This is Marriage&rsquo;, there&apos;s always a gem of wisdom for those looking for marriage or those already married.</p>

          <p>As an unmarried man who desires to walk that path someday, This is Marriage has exposed me to authentic married life and has been a blueprint for what I can try to emulate in my own life. I like that they discuss various issues that married people face and they don’t shy away from the difficult conversations.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Listening to the intimate conversations between Curtis and Wanitta are at times breathtaking as they are so authentic and vulnerable during these moments. Whilst the majority of the world are faking it to make it; This Is Marriage is authentic with zero sugar coating, just the real deal transparent married couple with over two decades of life experiences as a married couple.</p>

          <p>Your honest candid approach has been helpful to promote and create safety and reduce isolation. I wish I had this when I was going through my marriage difficulties, it may have helped us to survive the course.</p>
